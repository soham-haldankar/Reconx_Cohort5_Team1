# ADR Prompt Template

Every ADR in this folder is drafted using the prompt below, instantiated with
the specifics of the decision at hand, then critically reviewed and tightened
before being committed.

```
You are an enterprise software architect. Write an Architecture Decision Record
(ADR) in the Michael Nygard format (Title, Status, Context, Decision,
Consequences) for the following decision.

System: ReconX, a near-prod trade reconciliation platform.
Stack: PostgreSQL 16, Spring Boot 3, Kafka, React.
Scale: ~50,000 trades/day, 5-year retention, 10 concurrent recon analysts.

Decision to record: <ONE LINE DESCRIBING THE DECISION>

Alternatives we considered: <LIST 2-3>

Constraints / forces: <LIST 2-3>

Format: Markdown, Nygard 5-section template, no fluff. Keep under 300 words.
Include a "Status: Accepted | Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>" line.
```

The instantiated prompt used for each ADR is kept in a footer inside that
ADR's own file, so prompt and output travel together in the same PR.
